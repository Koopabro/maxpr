MaxPR for Get Smashed at the Foundry
====================================

Generates an Elo rating for all players in the Get Smashed at the Foundry from the smash.gg brackets using [TrueSkill](http://trueskill.org/).
Ratings go from 0 to 50.

Should hopefully be general enough to work with other smash.gg tournaments as well.
